I ranked only 4stars because I was disappointed with RETT training. I thought it will teach catching micros in realtime situations. But the videos were the same for all the possibilities. Explanation of the possible replies was nice but the potential of this training was not met. If I haven´t bought RETT in a package with the rest of the training, I would consider wanting the money back. But since I enjoyed the rest and find it beneficial to my life and work I consider the money well spent.    It would be great to have training not just with portraits but in real-time situations. It would get you closer to the Anatomy of lie. ;)"

On the contrary METT, SETT are realy training tools. Sadly, they are technicaly not quite polished. I had suggested a year ago, to enlarge a video, and as I noticed, you did so to some degree.
