I ranked only 4stars because I was disappointed with RETT training. I thought it will teach catching micros in realtime situations. But the videos were the same for all the possibilities. Explanation of the possible replies was nice but the potential of this training was not met. If I havenÂ´t bought RETT in a package with the rest of the training, I would consider wanting the money back. But since I enjoyed the rest and find it beneficial to my life and work I consider the money well spent.    It would be great to have training not just with portraits but in real-time situations. It would get you closer to the Anatomy of lie. ;)"

I just don't like paying for something that expires and nothing left to review or use after that time. However I am probably more a person for a book or a DVD to learn at my own pace and be able to review later again whenever I need to refresh my memory.
